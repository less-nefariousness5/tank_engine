# Tank Engine Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Created project directory structure
2. âœ… Created TODO.md outlining all components and implementations
3. âœ… Implemented main entry point (main.lua)
4. âœ… Implemented core framework:
   - API integration
   - Humanizer
   - Menu system
   - Settings manager
   - Variables and state tracking
5. âœ… Created module templates:
   - Threat Engine
   - Time-To-Death Engine
   - BigWigs/LittleWigs Integration
   - Healer Performance Engine
6. âœ… Implemented comprehensive example modules:
   - TTD Engine with linear regression
   - Threat Management with prioritization

## In Progress Tasks

1. ðŸ”„ Implement remaining module structures:
   - Defensive Engine
   - Mitigation Engine
   - Interrupt Engine
   - Pull Engine
   - Survival Engine
   - Resource Engine
2. ðŸ”„ Design intermodule communication system
3. ðŸ”„ Create data visualization components

## Next Steps

1. ðŸ“‹ Implement remaining module update logic and menu systems
2. ðŸ“‹ Develop on_update.lua files for all modules
3. ðŸ“‹ Integrate modules with the core framework
4. ðŸ“‹ Create class-specific implementations
5. ðŸ“‹ Implement UI visualizations for key metrics
6. ðŸ“‹ Create documentation and examples

## Notes

- The TTD Engine uses linear regression and should be tested against various combat scenarios
- The Threat Engine needs accurate threat API data to function properly
- BigWigs/LittleWigs bar parsing may need refinement for specific encounter mechanics
- Healer performance metrics should be calibrated against different healing styles

## Known Issues

- None at this stage (initial development)
